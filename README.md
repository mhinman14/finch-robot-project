# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
I chose to do a dancing robot. I included several different aspects such as making the robot move in different ways, left to right, forward to back, and I included the lights changing and some music aspects which allowed for the dancing to be fun and creative. I chose to change the lights throughout the dance because it would make the robot appear like its dancing and having fun. I also chose to add music so that the robot would have something to dance to and Mary Little Lamb was the song I chose. Finally, I mostly randomized the direction the robot moved just because if a person was dancing, the movements are mostly randomized and I wanted to try and replicate that.
## Challenges faced and solutions
During this project, I faced several challenges. At the beginning I had trouble figuring out how to open a new file and opening the terminal and trying to access different files. However, with Mr.Aiello's help I was able to figure out how to navigate through github and start my code. I also had trouble figuring out how to run the code for the robot but I did this by going to the schoology page and going to the student instructions, then seeing what I had to input into the terminal to be able to run the program. The last problem I had was figuring out how to code each part of the robot but I was able to solve this easily by going to the documentation for the finch robot.
## Future Enhancements
If I had more time for this project, there definitely would be many improvements I would like to have. I would probably make the dance longer or have the robot do more complicated things as well as include more java concepts and try to figure out how I could use it. I would probably also add a longer song for the dance.
